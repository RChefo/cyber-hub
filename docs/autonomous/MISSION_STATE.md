# Mission state: autonomous research and development mission

This file lets a new session resume the mission accurately. Times are UTC and measured with `date -u`.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Mission start | 2026-11-08T21:31:01Z |
| Branch | `release/v0.1.0` |
| HEAD at start | `092e092` (plus 27 uncommitted QA-audit paths) |
| Current phase | Implementation (feature 9 next: OWASP WSTG checklist) |

## Baseline (2026-11-08T21:31Z–21:45Z)

* Repository: Tauri 2, Rust, React 19, HeroUI v3, SQLite schema 12, 19 command modules.
* Pre-existing uncommitted QA-audit work re-verified, then committed as `676c23d`:
  * Rust: 257 passed, 1 ignored; clippy `-D warnings` clean.
  * Frontend: tsc clean, vitest 197 passed (30 files).
* Capabilities confirmed **absent** by code search:
  * scanner-output import (Nuclei, Burp, ZAP, SARIF; Nmap only from Cyber Hub's own runs);
  * finding templates;
  * a CVSS calculator for findings;
  * methodology checklists with coverage;
  * IOC extraction, defang and refang;
  * STIX export;
  * user-facing backup and restore.

## Research

See [../research/CYBER_HUB_MARKET_RESEARCH.md](../research/CYBER_HUB_MARKET_RESEARCH.md). All three research tracks are complete (community demand, competitor features, format specifications).

## Backlog

See [FEATURE_BACKLOG.md](FEATURE_BACKLOG.md).

## Completed features

1. Scanner-output import (`b51615a`)
2. Finding library with import rules (`95c8eac`)
3. Fix verification by rescan (`0e201f5`)
4. CVSS 4.0/3.1 on findings with a calculator (`edad2bf`)
5. IOC extractor, defang and refang, STIX 2.1 export (`38599a1`)
6. Greenbone/OpenVAS import (`99fe5ed`)
7. Findings CSV/JSON export (`0337e18`)
8. Bulk tag and assignee edit (`0337e18`)

## Tests executed

See [IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md](IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md).

## Known failures

None.

## Commits during the mission

| Commit | Subject |

| `676c23d` | fix(qa): harden active utilities against DNS rebinding and fix issues from the final QA audit |
| `b51615a` | feat(findings): import Nmap, Nuclei, Nessus, Burp, ZAP and SARIF results |
| `95c8eac` | feat(library): add a finding library with templates and import rules |

| `efe8605` | docs(research): add market research, scored backlog and mission state |
| `edad2bf` | feat(findings): add CVSS 4.0 and 3.1 vectors and a calculator to findings |
| `38599a1` | feat(intel): add an IOC extractor, defang and refang, and STIX 2.1 export |
| `3883ea5` | docs(mission): record features 4 and 5 in the mission log |
| `99fe5ed` | feat(findings): import Greenbone/OpenVAS reports |
| `0337e18` | feat(findings): export findings as CSV or JSON and edit tags in bulk |

## Next action

Feature 9: an OWASP WSTG checklist per project.

* Data comes from `OWASP/wstg` `checklists/checklist.json` (CC BY-SA 4.0: attribution, and ShareAlike for the adapted data file).
* Schema 17 adds `checklist_items`. The UI is a project tab with coverage.

Then the final regression (cargo audit, npm audit, gitleaks, bundle build) and the mission report.

## Resume instruction

1. Read this file, `FEATURE_BACKLOG.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`.
2. Run `git log --oneline -15` and `git status`.
3. Continue with the first backlog item that is not marked done. Verify each change with these commands:

   ```
   cargo test
   cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
   npx tsc -b --noEmit
   npx vitest run
   ```

4. Never build installers or publish anything.
