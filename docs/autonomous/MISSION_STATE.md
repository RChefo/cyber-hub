# Mission state: autonomous research and development mission

This file lets a new session resume the mission accurately. Times are UTC and measured with `date -u`.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Mission start | 2026-11-08T21:31:01Z |
| Branch | `release/v0.1.0` |
| HEAD at start | `092e092` (plus 27 uncommitted QA-audit paths) |
| Current phase | **Resumed** 2026-11-09T06:32:12Z on the owner's instruction ("continue"). The first segment ended 2026-11-08T23:43Z: see [MISSION_REPORT.md](MISSION_REPORT.md) |

## Baseline (2026-11-08T21:31Z–21:45Z)

* Repository: Tauri 2, Rust, React 19, HeroUI v3, SQLite schema 12, 19 command modules.
* Pre-existing uncommitted QA-audit work re-verified, then committed as `676c23d`:
  * Rust: 257 passed, 1 ignored; clippy `-D warnings` clean.
  * Frontend: tsc clean, vitest 197 passed (30 files).
* Capabilities confirmed **absent** by code search:
  * scanner-output import (Nuclei, Burp, ZAP, SARIF; Nmap only from Cyber Hub's own runs);
  * finding templates;
  * a CVSS calculator for findings;
  * methodology checklists with coverage;
  * IOC extraction, defang and refang;
  * STIX export;
  * user-facing backup and restore.

## Research

See [../research/CYBER_HUB_MARKET_RESEARCH.md](../research/CYBER_HUB_MARKET_RESEARCH.md). All three research tracks are complete (community demand, competitor features, format specifications).

## Backlog

See [FEATURE_BACKLOG.md](FEATURE_BACKLOG.md).

## Completed features

1. Scanner-output import (`b51615a`)
2. Finding library with import rules (`95c8eac`)
3. Fix verification by rescan (`0e201f5`)
4. CVSS 4.0/3.1 on findings with a calculator (`edad2bf`)
5. IOC extractor, defang and refang, STIX 2.1 export (`38599a1`)
6. Greenbone/OpenVAS import (`99fe5ed`)
7. Findings CSV/JSON export (`0337e18`)
8. Bulk tag and assignee edit (`0337e18`)
9. OWASP WSTG checklist (`9c4ee92`)
10. On-demand database backup (`4a320a8`)
11. Security review fixes (`c3f26af`, `da545e8`, `bd6d73e`)
12. CVSS 3.0 scoring fixed after a 709,160-vector comparison with FIRST's calculators (`b46a075`)
13. Database restore in the app (`2eb4209`)

## Tests executed

See [IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md](IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md).

## Known failures

None. The final results: Windows 302 Rust (306 with provisioning) and 217 frontend tests; Ubuntu 24.04 and Debian 12 303 Rust and 217 frontend tests; clippy, tsc, the build and the audits are clean.

## Next action

Second segment (from 2026-11-09T06:32Z), in this order:
1. ~~Verify CVSS scoring against FIRST's reference calculators~~: done (`b46a075`); it found and fixed CVSS 3.0 scoring.
2. ~~Restore from a backup inside the app~~: done (`2eb4209`); backlog item 12 is complete.
3. Expose the new capabilities through MCP (CVSS, finding library, checklist). **Next.**
4. More import formats, then notes, as time allows.

Release steps (installers, signing) need the owner's authorization.

## Resume instruction

1. Read this file, `FEATURE_BACKLOG.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`.
2. Run `git log --oneline -15` and `git status`.
3. Continue with the first backlog item that is not marked done. Verify each change with these commands:

   ```
   cargo test
   cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
   npx tsc -b --noEmit
   npx vitest run
   ```

4. Never build installers or publish anything.
